[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/gsa/data.gov.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/gsa/data.gov)
Data.gov
==============
[Data.gov](http://data.gov) is based on two robust open source projects: [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and [CKAN](http://ckan.org). The content seen at data.gov is powered by WordPress while the data catalog at catalog.data.gov is powered by CKAN. 

This repository provides the [issue tracker](https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/issues) for all code, bugs, and feature requests related to these websites. Currently the repository is only used for source version control on the code for the WordPress template, but you will also find pointers to the relevant CKAN code documented below.

In addition to this repository, please be sure to look at the Data.gov Developers section for more updates and resources: http://data.gov/developers/


## WordPress
The latest version of WordPress is available at: http://wordpress.org/download/

###Theme

The theme is provided in the `/themes/` folder. The theme is based on [roots.io](http://roots.io/starter-theme/).

###Plugins

See the [plugins](plugins.md) page for a list of all the plugins used.

### Deployment
This is a standard WordPress install, so please refer to the [WordPress Docs](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress). In the near future we hope to release the configuration for installing the Data.gov WordPress using [WordPress CLI](http://wp-cli.org/). 

## CKAN

The code used for the catalog.data.gov instance of CKAN is available on [Github](https://github.com/okfn/ckan/tree/release-datagov), but we recommend the [latest version of CKAN](http://ckan.org/developers/docs-and-download/). 

### Extensions

Data.gov has developed several CKAN extensions, but these are still in the process of being packaged for more widespread use. Most of these extentions are referenced in an [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/) [build script](https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-geodatagov/blob/dev/deployment/datagov-buildserver.yml), but there is also an extension to support [data.json harvesting](https://github.com/FuhuXia/ckanext-datajson/tree/master). Please check back here or [contact us](https://www.data.gov/contact) for more details on the extensions used.

### Deployment

We are in the process of improving documentation and hope to provide build scripts and configurations for tools like [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) to make setting up the Data.gov CKAN easier for others. Please check back here or [contact us](https://www.data.gov/contact) for more information about our CKAN stack. 

## Design Assets

The source graphic files for the design assets (logo, icons, layout) are available in the [Data.gov Design Assets](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-design) repository.
